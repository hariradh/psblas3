!               The communication step among processors at each       *
!               matrix-vector  product is a variable all-to-all       *
!               collective communication that we reimplement          *
!               in terms of point-to-point communications.            *
!               The data in input is a list of dependencies:          *
!               for each node a list of all the nodes it has to       *
!               communicate with. The lists are guaranteed to be      *
!               symmetric, i.e. for each pair (I,J) there is a        *
!               pair (J,I). The idea is to organize the ordering      *
!               so   that at each communication step as many          *
!               processors as possible are communicating at the       *
!               same time, i.e. a step is defined by the fact         *
!               that all edges (I,J) in it have no common node.       *
!                                                                     *
!               Formulation of the problem is:                        *
!                 Given an undirected graph (forest):                 *
!                 Find the shortest series of steps to cancel all     *
!                 graph edges, where at each step all edges belonging *
!                 to a matching in the graph are canceled.            *
!                                                                     *
!               An obvious lower bound to the optimum number of steps *
!               is the largest degree of any node in the graph.       *
!                                                                     *
!               The algorithm proceeds as follows:                    *
!               1. Build a list of all edges, e.g. copy the           *
!                  dependencies lists keeping only (I,J) with I<J     *
!               2. Compute an auxiliary vector with the degree of     *
!                  each node of the graph.                            *
!               3. While there are edges in the graph do:             *
!               4. Weight the edges with the sum of the degrees       *
!                  of their nodes and sort them into descending order *
!               5. Scan the list of edges; if neither node of the     *
!                  edge has been marked yet, cancel the edge and mark *
!                  the two nodes                                      *
!               6. If no edge was chosen but the graph is nonempty    *
!                  raise an error condition                           *
!               7. Queue the edges in the matchin to the output       *
!                  sequence;                                          *
!               8. Decrease by 1 the degree of all marked nodes,      *
!                  then clear all marks                               *
!               9. Cycle to 3.                                        *
!              10. For each node: scan the edge sequence; if an       *
!                  edge has the node as an endpoint, queue the other  *
!                  node in the dependency list for the current one    *
!                                                                     *
