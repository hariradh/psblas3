!   This subroutine sorts an integer array into ascending order.

! Arguments:
!   n         -  integer                   Input: size of the array 
!   k         -  integer(*)                input: array of keys to be sorted
!   l         -  integer(0:n+1)           output: link list 
!   iret      -  integer                  output: 0 Normal termination
!                                                 1 the array was already sorted
